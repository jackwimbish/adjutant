## Project Context Rule

**For queries about:**
- "What is this project's architecture|data model|plan|overview|stack?"
- "How does this app work?"
- "Tell me about this project."

**Read these files first:**
- `_docs/project-overview.md`
- `_docs/data-model.md`
- `_docs/development-plan.md`

## Universal Rules

### Always Ignore
- `node_modules`
- `dist`
- `release-builds`
- `out`
- `package-lock.json`
- `.git`

### Project Hints
- This is an Electron application written in TypeScript.
- The project uses Firebase Firestore as its database.
- The AI processing is handled by LangGraph and the OpenAI API.
- Follow a clean, modular coding style. Add comments for complex logic.

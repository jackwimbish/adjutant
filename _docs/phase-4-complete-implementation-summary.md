    const thresholdMet = relevantCount >= 2 && notRelevantCount >= 2;
    return { thresholdMet, relevantCount, notRelevantCount, message };
});

// UI Integration with automatic visibility
async function checkProfileThreshold() {
    const result = await window.electronAPI.checkLearnerThreshold();
    const profileBtn = document.getElementById('profile-btn');
    
    if (result.thresholdMet) {
        profileBtn.style.display = 'flex';
